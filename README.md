# All of the Above Inspections — Static Site

This repo contains a single-file website with built-in theme switcher and transparent pricing.

## How to deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repo and upload these files to the repo **root** (not in a subfolder): `index.html`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages** and set **Source** to "Deploy from a branch" → `main` → `/ (root)`.
3. Wait for Pages to build, then visit your site URL shown at the top of the Pages settings.

## Optional
- Update links in `sitemap.xml` to match your real domain.
- Replace the form endpoint if/when you add a form.
